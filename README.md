# enhanced_facial_-detection_and_super_resolution
 This project is divided into two parts. The first part involves detecting multiple faces from a blurred image, such as one captured by a surveillance camera at a train station. The second part focuses on the blurred faces themselves, cropping the images and then applying super-resolution techniques to clarify them.
